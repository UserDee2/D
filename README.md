Started Development: June 15, 2023
Honestly, trip trip lang 'to and a challenge for me to test kung kaya ko ba 'tong tapusin, kasi kapag gumagawa ako ng project na alam kong bubuhos ako ng madaming oras dito, and would spend so many days to reach the finished product, I lose motivation somewhere in the middle, kaya I'm genuinely proud sa sarili ko for managing to finish this personal project!

Note: Baguhan lang po ako sa world of web dev, I started early June this year, kaya in some points, medyo rough pa yung pagkakagawa ko, and also, web design is my weak point, pero pag-aaralan ko yan for the next time around! Also, mag-isa ko lang 'tong ginawa so it took longer than expected.

Hope you enjoy browsing this static website! And also, di pa ako marunong mag adjust to different screen sizes sa website, kaya maybe I'll add some changes in the future?
